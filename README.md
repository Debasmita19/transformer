# Spiking Decision Transformer: Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Event-Based Sequence Modeling

**[Link to Paper (Coming Soon)]] | [Contact: pandeyvishal.mlprof@gmail.com]**

## Overview

Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex sequential decision-making tasks. Recent advancements, such as the Decision Transformer (DT), have reframed RL as a sequence modeling problem, leveraging the power of Transformer architectures. However, the computational intensity and dense operations inherent in standard Transformers limit their applicability in resource-constrained environments, particularly for low-power, real-time inference.

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a compelling alternative, promising substantial energy savings by processing information through sparse, asynchronous binary events. This work introduces the **Spiking Decision Transformer (SDT)**, a novel architecture that synergistically integrates the sequence modeling strengths of Transformers with the efficiency of spiking dynamics and the biological plausibility of local learning rules.

Our key contributions are:
1.  **First Spiking Decision Transformer:** We present the pioneering architecture that successfully combines Transformer-based sequence control with event-driven, spiking neural processing for RL tasks.
2.  **Embedded Three-Factor Plasticity:** The action generation mechanism incorporates a local three-factor Hebbian-like plasticity rule, enabling online adaptation and learning within the spiking framework.
3.  **Learned Phase-Shifted Spike Generators:** We replace conventional floating-point positional embeddings with efficient, learnable spike generators that encode temporal information through phase shifts.
4.  **Efficient Spike-Attention Mechanism:** Parallel spike-attention heads are dynamically routed and managed by a compact gating Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), ensuring sparse and efficient information flow.

We demonstrate the efficacy of the SDT on standard offline RL control benchmarks. Our model achieves performance comparable to or exceeding that of conventional Decision Transformers while operating with remarkable sparsity, emitting fewer than ten spikes per decision. This high efficiency suggests the potential for up to **four orders of magnitude in per-inference energy savings** when deployed on neuromorphic hardware.
