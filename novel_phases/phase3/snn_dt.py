    # 2. Replace nn.Identity() for self.spiking_attention_layers with your actual Spiking Attention module.

    #         # Input to linear layers should be [B*L, d_in]
    #         # Spikes are T_in long, so process each time step or sum/average spikes first
    #         # This part is highly dependent on how SNN attention is formulated.
    #         # For simplicity, let's assume we project based on summed spikes (losing temporal info before LIF)
    #         # or operate per time step (computationally intensive).
    #
    #         # A more SNN-idiomatic way would be to have weights that directly process spike trains.
    #         # Let's assume a simplified version where projections are applied to the 'd' dimension
    #         # and LIF dynamics are applied over T.
    #
    #         # This placeholder is too simplistic for a real SNN attention.
    #         # A proper SNN attention would involve projecting spikes, computing spike-based attention scores,
    #         # and then applying these to value spikes, all potentially within a LIF neuron model.

    #         # with a real Siking Attention mechanism that processes [B,L,H,d,T] -> [B,L,H,d,T]

    #     SpikingAttentionHead(self.embed_dim // self.num_heads, self.T) for _ in range(self.num_layers) # Assuming d is split across heads
    # ])
    #
    # In the forward pass, you'd iterate through heads or have a multi-head attention module.
    # The current SNNDT model assumes self.spiking_attention_layers[i] handles all heads.
    # So, SpikingAttention (not Head) should take [B,L,H,d,T] and output [B,L,H,d,T].

    # 3. The `embeddings` input to `forward` is assumed to be [B, L, d_model].
    #    If your input is raw tokens or states, you'll need an embedding layer before this model.
    #
    # 4. The architecture now includes multiple SNN blocks (controlled by `num_layers`).
    #    Each block consists of:
    #    - Rate coding (conditionally, see comments) & Positional Encoding
    #    - Spiking Attention & Dendritic Routing
    #    - Residual connection & LayerNorm
    #    - Feed-Forward Network (FFN)
    #    - Residual connection & LayerNorm
    #    This structure is similar to a standard Transformer encoder layer, adapted for SNN components.
    #
    # 5. The `pos_encoder` is called with `x` inside the loop. This means positional encoding
    #    is re-applied at each layer based on the output of the previous layer.
    #    If positional information is only needed once from the initial embeddings,
    #    `pos_mask` should be computed once outside the loop using the initial `embeddings`.
    #    Example:
    #    initial_pos_mask = self.pos_encoder(embeddings)
    #    Then use `initial_pos_mask` inside the loop.
    #    The current implementation recomputes it using `x` (output of previous layer)
    #    which might be intended if `x` retains positional relevance or if the positional encoding
    #    is meant to adapt to the transformed features at each layer.
    #    Given `PositionalSpikeEncoder`'s docstring "Given a batch of token embeddings",
    #    it's likely intended to be used with the initial embeddings.
    #
    #    Corrected usage for pos_mask (if used only once):
    #    pos_mask_global = self.pos_encoder(embeddings) # Computed once
    #    Inside loop: masked_spikes = expanded_rate_spikes * pos_mask_global.unsqueeze(0).unsqueeze(1).unsqueeze(3)

    # 6. Rate Coder placement: The current code places `rate_coder` inside the loop,
    #    implying that the output of each SNN block (`x`) is converted back to continuous values,
    #    and then re-coded into spikes for the next block.
    #    If `x` remains in the spike domain (e.g., as spike counts or membrane potentials)
    #    throughout the SNN layers, then `rate_coder` should only be applied once at the beginning.
    #    The integration of SNN layers (how output of one feeds into next) is critical.
    #    The current residual connections `x + merged` and `x_norm1 + ffn_output` assume `merged`
    #    and `ffn_output` are continuous values, compatible with `x`.
    #    If `merged` is spike data, the addition and LayerNorm need to be SNN-compatible.
    #    The DendriticRouter outputs `merged` as [B,L,d], which appears continuous.
    #    This implies that the output of the SNN part of the block (attention+router) is continuous.
    #    This is a common pattern in hybrid approaches or when SNNs output rate-coded continuous values.
    #    If so, re-applying rate_coder to `x` (which is now continuous) for the next layer is logical.
