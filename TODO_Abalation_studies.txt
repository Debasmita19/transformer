- Decision SpikeFormer as a Baseline Run.
- Spike Transformer RL as a Baseline Run
- Mid-Scale Environment Experiment [MuJoCo HalfCheetah-Small: generate 10k steps (50% expert, 50% random), train SNN-DT, then ablate]
- Energy Estimate Table [Convert average spikes to joules using neuromorphic hardware specs]

Mid-Scale Environment Experiment is depend on the time:
If we have the time then we will go for all the MuJoCo Tasks
- m-e (medium expert) tasks: HalfCheetah, Walker2d, hopper
- m-r (medium replay) tasks: HalfCheetah, Walker2d, hopper
- m (medium policy) tasks: HalfCheetah, Walker2d, hopper


Otherwise we will go for the firdt baseline run
